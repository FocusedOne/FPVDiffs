# FPVDiffs

I intend to keep the configs for FPV drones here.

The only config currently is for the iflight Blitz F411 ELRS board as installed in my iFlight Alpha A65.

This is an older drone where the controller / vtx had an issue.  I purchased the new Blitz F411 board and received mountains of help from friends to get it going.  The F411 shipped with zero config and there are (as of January 2023) no factory dumps available for the A65 with this board and ELRS.

SO, this is a quick setup (mostly accomplished by people helping me) to get the A65 flying with the new board.

Oddly, one of the ESCs had to be set backwards from the rest.  Maybe that's a bug in my board or possibly they're all that way.
